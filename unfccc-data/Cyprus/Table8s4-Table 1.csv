"(1) Estimate the percentage change due to recalculation with respect to the previous submission (percentage change = 100 x [(LS-PS)/PS], where LS = latest submission and PS = previous submission. All cases of recalculation of the estimate of the source/sink category should be addressed and explained in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Total emissions refer to total aggregate GHG emissions expressed in terms of CO2 equivalent, excluding GHGs from the LULUCF sector. The impact of the recalculation on the total emissions is calculated as follows:  impact of recalculation (%) = 100 x [(source (LS) - source (PS))/total emissions (LS)], where LS = latest submission, PS = previous submission.",,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Parties should provide detailed information on recalculations in Chapter 10: Recalculations and Improvements, and in the relevant sections of Chapters 3 to 8 (see section 2.5 of each of Chapters 3 - 8) of the national inventory report (NIR).   Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"References should point particularly to the sections of the NIR in which justifications of the changes as to improvements in accuracy, completeness and consistency of the inventory are reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
