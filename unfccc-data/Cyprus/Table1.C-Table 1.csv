(1) Excluding recycled carbon dioxide (CO2) for enhanced recovery.,,,,
(2) Corrected for baseline background fluxes.,,,,
(3)  Fugitive emissions during above-ground operations such as processing and CO2 recycling during enhanced oil and gas recovery operations should be reported as fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas and reported under the appropriate categories for that sector.,,,,
"(4) Once captured, there is no differentiated treatment between biogenic carbon and fossil carbon. Emissions and storage of both biogenic and fossil carbon will be estimated and reported.",,,,
(5) It should be checked that the mass of CO2 captured does no exceed the mass of CO2 stored plus the fugitive emissions (leakage) reported for the inventory year.,,,,
"(6) Ideally the value should be zero (see page 5.19, volume 2 of the 2006 IPCC guidelines).",,,,

Documentation box:,,,,
Parties should provide detailed explanations on CO2 transport and storage in the corresponding part of chapter 3: energy (CRF subsector 1.C) of the NIR. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,
