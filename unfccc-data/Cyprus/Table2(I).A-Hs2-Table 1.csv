"(1)   Where the IPCC Guidelines provide options for activity data (AD), e.g. cement production or clinker production for estimating the emissions from cement production, specify the activity data used (as shown in the example in parentheses) in order to make the choice of emission factor more transparent and to facilitate comparisons of implied emission factors (IEFs). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   The IEFs are estimated on the basis of gross emissions as follows: IEF = (emissions + amounts recovered, oxidized, destroyed or transformed) / AD. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)   Final emissions are to be reported (after subtracting the amounts of emission recovery, oxidation, destruction or transformation). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)   Amounts of emission recovery, oxidation, destruction or transformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5) If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from non-energy products from fuels  and solvent use not included in subcategories 2.D.1-2.D.2 here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6) Emissions from urea used as a catalyst should be reported here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7) If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from N2O from product uses not included in subcategory G.3.a here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8) If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available Parties should include all emissions from industrial processes not included in subcategories 2.A-2.G here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the industrial processes sector in chapter 4: industrial processes (CRF sector 2) of the national inventory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• In relation to metal production, more specific information (e.g. data on virgin and recycled steel production) could be provided in this documentation box, or in the NIR, together with a reference to the relevant section of the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Confidentiality: Where only aggregate figures for activity data are provided, e.g. due to reasons of confidentiality, a note indicating this should be provided in this documentation box. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
