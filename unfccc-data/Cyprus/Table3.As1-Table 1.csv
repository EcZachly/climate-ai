"(1)   Parties are encouraged to provide detailed livestock population data by animal type and region, if available, in the national inventory report (NIR), and provide in the documentation box below a reference to the relevant section. Parties should use the same animal population statistics to estimate methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation, CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) from manure management, N2O direct emissions from soil and N2O emissions associated with manure production, as well as emissions from the use of manure as fuel, and sewage-related emissions reported in the waste sector. ",,,,,
(2)    Ym refers to the fraction of gross energy in feed converted to CH4 and should be given in per cent in this table.,,,,,
"(3)   Including data on dairy heifers, if available.",,,,,
(4)   Option C should be used when Parties want to report a more disaggregate livestock categorization compared with option A and option B. ,,,,,
"(5)  If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from other livestock not included in subcategories 3.A.1-3.A.3 under other (please specify).",,,,,
(6)   This could include fox and raccoon and mink and polecat.,,,,,

Documentation box:,,,,,
"• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the agriculture sector, including information from the additional information box, in chapter 5: Agriculture (CRF sector 3) of the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,
"• Provide a reference to the relevant section in the NIR, in particular with regard to: ",,,,,
(a) Disaggregation of livestock population (e.g. according to the classification recommended in the 2006 IPCC guidelines;,,,,,
(b) Parameters relevant to the application of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.,,,,,
