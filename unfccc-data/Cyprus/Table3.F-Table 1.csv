"(2) If Parties use a different methodology than the IPCC default, e.g. based on crop production, the estimate for total biomass burned can be reported without data on area, fuel available and combustion factor. In this case the additional information table should be used to report the parameters used to derive the total biomass burned.",,,,,,,,

Parties should provide detailed explanations on the agriculture sector in chapter 5: Agriculture (CRF sector 3) of the national invnetory report (NIR). Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"3.F.1.2: NE notation key was used due to the fact that no default (CF) is proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.
