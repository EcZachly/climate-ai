Use the following notation keys to specify the method applied:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D (IPCC default),,"T1a, T1b, T1c (IPCC Tier 1a, Tier 1b and Tier 1c, respectively) ",,,,,CR (CORINAIR),,M (model),,,,,,,

T1 (IPCC Tier 1) ,,T3 (IPCC Tier 3),,,,,OTH (Other),,,,,,,,,
"If using more than one method within one source category, list all the relevant methods. Explanations regarding country-specific methods, other methods or any modifications to the default IPCC methods, as well as  information regarding the use of different methods per source category where more than one method is indicated, should be provided in the documentation box. Also use the documentation box to explain the use of notation OTH. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
