"Note:  For the coverage of fuel categories, refer to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (chapter 1 of energy volume, section 1.4.1.1, page 1.11). If some derived gases (e.g. gas works, gas, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas) are considered, Parties should provide information on the allocation of these derived gases under the above fuel categories (liquid, solid, gaseous, biomass and other fuels) in the NIR (see also documentation box at the end of sheet 4 of this table).",,,,,,,,,
