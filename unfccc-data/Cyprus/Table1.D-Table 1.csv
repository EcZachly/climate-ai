(1) Include information in the documentation box on which fuels are included and provide a reference to the section in the national inventory report  (NIR) where further information is provided. ,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   Parties may choose to report or not report the activity data and implied emission factors for multilateral operations, consistent with the principle of confidentiality stated in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines. In any case, Parties should report the emissions from multilateral operations, where available, under memo iItems in the summary tables and in the sectoral report table for energy.",,,,,,,,,      ,,

"(a) For calculating the allocation of fuel consumption, the sums of fuel consumption for domestic navigation and aviation (table 1.A(a)) and for international bunkers (table 1.D) are used.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation Box:,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the  fuel combustion subsector, including international aviation and international navigation, in the corresponding part of  chapter 3: energy (CRF subsector 1.A) of the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
"• Provide in this documentation box a brief explanation of how the consumption of international aviation and international navigation fuels was estimated and separated from domestic consumption, and include a reference to the section of the NIR where the explanation is provided in more detail.",,,,,,,,,,,
