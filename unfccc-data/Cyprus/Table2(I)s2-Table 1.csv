"(1)   The emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), unspecified mix of HFCs and PFCs, and other fluorinated gases are to be expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Data on disaggregated emissions of HFCs and PFCs are to be provided in table 2(II).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)   ODS ozone-depleting substances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3)  Carbon dioxide (CO2) from food and drink production (e.g. gasification of water) can be of biogenic or non-biogenic origin. Only information on CO2 emissions of non-biogenic origin should be reported. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Documentation box:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parties should provide detailed explanations on the industrial processes sector in chapter 4: industrial processes (CRF sector 2) of the national inventory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"2.G.1 SF6: where NE is used, the necessary activity data is not available to estimate the amounts or the emissions. The emissions have been estimated based on a country specific method and are all assumed to be from stocks since no data is available to estimate emissions from disposal.",,,,,,,,,,,,
