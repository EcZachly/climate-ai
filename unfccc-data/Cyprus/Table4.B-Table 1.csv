"(1)  Land categories may be further divided according to climate zone, management system, soil type, including whether the soil is drained, rewetted or categorized as other, vegetation type, tree species, ecological zone or national land classification.  When Parties estimate emissions and removals or carbon stock change on dry and wet soils separately, they are encouraged to use this column to provide this disaggregation. When a Party reports emissions and removals from coastal wetlands areas that are not part of the total land area of the country, a Party may use appropriate subcategories for indicating whether the emissions and removals come from areas included or excluded from the total land area of the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) The total area of the subcategories, in accordance with the subdivision used, should be entered here. For lands converted to cropland report the cumulative area remaining in the category in the reporting year. The total area should equal the area of mineral soil plus the area of organic soil by subcategory. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)  Carbon stock gains and losses should be listed separately except in cases where, due to the methods used, it is technically impossible to separate information on gains and losses.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(4) The signs for estimates of gains in carbon stocks are positive (+) and for losses in carbon stocks are negative (â€“).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)  Parties who wish to do so may report annual on-site CO2-C emissions/removals and off-site CO2-C emissions from drained and rewetted organic soils here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6)  For category 4.B.1 Cropland remaining cropland this column only includes changes in perennial woody biomass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7)  No reporting on dead organic matter pools is required  for category 4.B.1. Cropland remaining cropland. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8) When Parties cannot estimate carbon stock changes for organic and mineral soil separately, these should be reported under mineral soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9) Where Parties directly estimate emissions and removals rather than carbon stock changes, they may report emissions/removals directly in this column and use notation keys in the stock change columns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(10) A Party may report aggregated estimates for all land conversions to cropland, when data are not available to report them separately. A Party should specify in the documentation box which types of land conversion are included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Parties should provide detailed explanations on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in Chapter 6: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (CRF sector 4) of the national inventory report (NIR). Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
