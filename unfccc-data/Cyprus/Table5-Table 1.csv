(1)   CO2 emissions from the categories solid waste disposal on land and waste incineration should only be included if they derive from non-biological or inorganic waste sources.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)  Long-term storage of carbon in waste disposal sites,  Annual change in total long-term storage of carbon stored and Annual change in long-term storage of carbon in HWP waste should be entered as carbon dioxide (CO2).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)  Carbon stored in wood, paper, cardboard, garden and park  waste (equals to the annual change in stocks of harvested wood products in solid waste disposal sites from consumption, second activity data in the table for harvested wood products).",,,,,,,,,,,
"Documentation box:  
• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the waste sector in chapter 7: waste (CRF sector 5) of the national inventory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,
"• If estimates are reported under 5.E  Other, use this documentation box to provide information regarding activities covered under this category and to provide reference to the section in the NIR where background information can be found. ",,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"5.A.2: Included elsewhere: ""IPCC Waste model"" was used. Breakdown not available.
5.D.2: Sludge removed: No data available
N in effluent: Emission factor was based on volume of wastewater, therefore N in inffluent not estimated.
