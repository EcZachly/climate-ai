"(1) Carbon excluded from fuel combustion is either emitted in another sector of the inventory (for example as industrial process emissions) or is stored for long periods of time in a product manufactured from the fuel and therefore no emissions occur (for example, bitumen/asphalt used for road paving). Column I includes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from non-energy use and column J documents where in the inventory these emissions are reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) The fraction of carbon excluded from reference approach relates CO2 from carbon excluded to CO2 reported in the reference approach. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) If the emissions from the fuel are reported in more than one category, list them in the table and provide further details in the documentation box and in the national inventory report  (NIR). For the different NEU of fuels see also table 1.6, page 1.26, chapter 1, volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (same as table 2.1. page T.27, volume 1).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)   Enter data for those fuels that are used as feedstocks (fuel used as raw materials for manufacture of products such as plastics or fertilizers), reductant or for other non-energy use (fuels not used as fuel or transformed into another fuel (e.g. bitumen for road construction, lubricants)). For other fuels, use notation key ""NO"" (not occurring).",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Parties should provide detailed explanations on the fuel consumption for non-energy uses, in the corresponding part of chapter 3.2.3. Feedstocks and non-energy use of fuels of the NIR. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.
