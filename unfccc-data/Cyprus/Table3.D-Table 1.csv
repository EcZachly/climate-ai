"(1)   To convert from N2O-N to N2O emissions, multiply by 44/28. ",,,,
"(2)   For cultivation of histosols the unit of the IEF is kg N2O–N/ha. The emissions from cultivation/management of croplands and grasslands are to be included. For a definition of organic soils, see footnote 4, page 11.6 of chapter 11 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,
"(3)    Include the application of fertilizers on cropland and grassland. If the application of fertilizers to other land categories cannot be separately identified, this application should be included here.",,,,
(4)   Emissions from management changes in cropland remaining cropland would be reported in this table. ,,,,
"(5)  Methodologies for N2O emissions from N mineralization/immobilization associated with loss/gain of soil organic matter resulting management of mineral soils are based on equations 11.1, 11.2 and 11.8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. N2O immobilization associated with gain of organic matter resulting from management of mineral soils can be reported only when a Party applies a tier 3 approach in the relevant calculation.",,,,
"(6)   Only atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) volatilised from agricultural inputs of N are to be reported here, not including NOx associated with the burning of savannahs and crop residues.",,,,
