"(3)   Clearly indicate sources and sinks in the submitted inventory that are allocated to a sector other than that indicated by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Show the sector indicated in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the sector to which the source or sink is allocated in the submitted inventory. Explain the reason for reporting these sources and sinks in a different sector/category.
