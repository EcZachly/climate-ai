.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) The methodology for estimating non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning is described in section 2.4 of chapter 2 of volume 4 of the 2066 IPCC Guidelines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Parties should report both controlled/prescribed burning and wildfires emissions, where appropriate, in a separate manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) When Parties estimate emissions from biomass burning on mineral and organic soils separately they are encouraged to use this column to provide this disaggregation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) For each category, activity data should be selected between area burned or biomass burned. The units for area will be ha and for biomass burned will be kg dm. The implied emission factor will refer to the selected activity data with an automatic change in the units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)  If  carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass burning are not already included in tables 4.A – 4.F, they should be reported here. This should be clearly documented in the documentation box and in the  national inventory report (NIR).  Double counting should be avoided. Parties that include all carbon stock changes in the carbon stock tables (4.A–F), should report ""IE"" (included elsewhere) in this column. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6) Parties who wish to do so may report CO2 emissions from burning of organic soils here.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7) CH4 and N2O emissions associated with the burning of forest land and grassland defined as savannah should be reported under the agriculture sector. CO2 emissions/removals associated with burning of savannahs should be included here, taking into account footnote 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(8)  In situ above-ground woody biomass burning is reported here. Agricultural residue burning is reported in the agriculture sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Documentation box:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Parties should provide detailed explanations on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in Chapter 6: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (CRF sector 4) of the NIR. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
