"(1)   Climate regions are defined in terms of annual average temperature as follows: cool = less than 15 °C; temperate = 15–25 °C inclusive; and  warm = greater than 25 °C (see table 10.17 of chapter 10, volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines).",,,,,,,,,
"(2)   VS = volatile solids;  Bo = maximum methane producing capacity for manure (pp. 10.42 and 10.43 of chapter 10, volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines); dm = dry matter. Provide average values for VS and Bo where original calculations were made at a more disaggregated level of these livestock categories. ",,,,,,,,,
"(3)   Including data on dairy heifers, if available.",,,,,,,,,
(4)   Option C should be used when Parties want to report a more disaggregated livestock categorization compared with option A and option B. ,,,,,,,,,
"(5)  If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from other livestock not included in subcategories 3.B.1-3.B.3 under other (please specify).",,,,,,,,,
(6)   This could include fox and raccoon and mink and polecat. ,,,,,,,,,

• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the agriculture sector in chapter 5: Agriculture (CRF sector 3) of the national invenotry report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,,
"• Provide a reference to the relevant section in the NIR, in particular with regard to: ",,,,,,,,,
(a) Disaggregation of livestock population (e.g. according to the classification recommended in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines;,,,,,,,,,
(b) Parameters relevant to the application of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines;,,,,,,,,,
