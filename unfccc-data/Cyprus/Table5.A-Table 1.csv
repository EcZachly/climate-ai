"Note: SWDS = solid waste disposal site, MCF = methane correction factor, DOCf = fraction of degradable organic carbon that decomposes, DOC = degradable organic carbon (IPCC Guidelines (Volume 5, section 3.2.3)). ",,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: Annual waste includes household waste, yard/garden waste, commercial/institutional waste, sludge, industrial and other waste.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: The is no methodology in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines to estimate emissions from flaring based on recovered biogas from solid waste disposal sites and wastewater handling. If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) under category 5.E.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) The CH4 implied emission factor (IEF) is calculated on the basis of gross CH4 emissions as follows: IEF = (CH4 emissions + CH4 recovered)/annual waste at the SWDS. ,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Actual emissions (after flaring and recovery).,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) When recovered CH4 emissions are used for energy, the emissions from the combustion should be reported under category 1.A and are provided here for information only.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Under solid waste disposal, CO2 emissions should be reported only when the disposed waste is combusted at the disposal site as a management practice. CO2 emissions from non-biogenic waste are included in the total emissions, whereas the CO2 emissions from biogenic waste are not included in the total emissions.  ",,,,,,,,,,,

• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the waste sector in chapter 7: waste (CRF sector 5) of the national invnetory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Parties that use country-specific models should provide a reference in the documentation box to the relevant section in the NIR where these models are described, and fill in only the relevant cells of table 5.A.",,,,,,,,,,,
"• Provide a reference to the relevant section in the NIR, in particular with regard to: ",,,,,,,,,,,
           (a) The population size (total or urban population) used in the calculations and the rationale for doing so;,,,,,,,,,,,
           (b) The composition of landfilled waste. ,,,,,,,,,,,
• Parties should specify the category in the energy sector under which the emissions from energy recovery are reported. ,,,,,,,,,,,
