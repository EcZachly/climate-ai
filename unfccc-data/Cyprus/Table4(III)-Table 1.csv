"  (1) Methodologies for N2O emissions from N mineralization associated with loss of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or management of mineral soils are based on equations 11.1, 11.2 and 11.8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. N2O immobilization associated with gain of organic matter resulting from change of land use or management of mineral soils can be reported only when a Party applies a tier 3 approach in the relevant calculation. ",,,,,,
(2) N2O emissions from Cropland remaining cropland are included in the agriculture sector ,,,,,,
" (3) The total area of the subcategories, in accordance with the subdivision used, should be entered here.  For lands remaining in the category, the area subject to management changes should be reported. For converted lands the cumulative area remaining in the category in the reporting year should be reported here.",,,,,,
"(4)  In the calculation of the implied emission factor, N2O emissions are converted to N2O–N by multiplying by 28/44.",,,,,,
"(5)  If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from land conversion here. ",,,,,,

"Parties should provide detailed explanations on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in Chapter 6: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (CRF sector 4) of the national inventory report (NIR). Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,
