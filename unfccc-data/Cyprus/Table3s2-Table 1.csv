"(1)   The sum for cattle would be calculated on the basis of entries made under either option A (dairy and non-dairy cattle), option B (mature dairy cattle, other mature cattle and growing cattle) or option C (other disaggreagtion of cattle categories).",,,,,,
"(2)   Categories reported under ""Agricultural soils"" are those reported under table 3.D.",,,,,,
"(3)   Direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions generated by manure in the system ""Pasture, range and paddock"" are to be reported under the category ""Direct N2O emissions from managed soils"". See also section 10.5 of Volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. ",,,,,,
"(4)   Indirect N2O emissions generated by manure in the system ""Pasture, range and paddock"" are to be reported under the category ""Indirect N2O emissions from managed soils"". See also section 10.5 of Volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. ",,,,,,
"Note: The 2006 IPCC Guidelines do not provide methodologies for the calculation of methane (CH4) emissions and CH4 and N2O removals from agricultural soils, or carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from prescribed burning of savannas and field burning of agricultural residues. Parties that have estimated such emissions should provide, in the national inventory report (NIR), additional information (activity data and emission factors) used to derive these estimates and include a reference to the section of the NIR in the documentation box of the corresponding Sectoral background data tables.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Documentation box: ,,,,,,
• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the agriculture sector in chapter 5: Agriculture (CRF sector 3) of the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,
"• If estimates are reported under category 3(II).H.Other, use this documentation box to provide information regarding activities covered under this category and to provide reference to the section in the NIR where background information can be found. ",,,,,,
Documentation box,"3.A.1 Non-Dairy Cattle: The information is not sufficient to implement T2 methodology.
3.B.2.1 Dairy Cattle: L8: Methodology: Solid storage according to the guidelines
L11: Methodology: Anaerobic treatment according to the guidelines
3.B.2.1 Non-Dairy Cattle: L8: Methodology: Solid storage according to the quidelines
L11: Methodoligy: Anaerobic treatment according to the quidelines
3.B.2.2 Sheep: L8: Methodology: Solid storage according to the quidelines
3.B.2.3 Breeding swine: NMVOC (included elsewhere - Market swine)
L6: Methodology: Aerobic treatment according to the quidelines.
L11: Methodoligy: Anaerobic digester according to the quidelines
3.B.2.3 Market swine: L6: Methodology: Aerobic treatment according to the quidelines
L11: Methodology: Anaerobic digester according to the quidelines
3.B.2.5: No methodology recommended by the IPCC guidelines
3.D.1.6: Cyprus does not have agriculture soils with high organic matter.
3.D.AI.2: emissions from animal waste/sludge applied to soil not estimated due to unavailability of data
3.F.1.2: NE notation key was used due to the fact that no default (CF) is proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.
3.F.2.1.i Bean and Pulses: NE notation key was used due to the fact that no default (CF) is proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.
3.F.3.1.i Potatoes: NE notation key was used due to the fact that no default (CF) is proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,,
