"(1)  The column ""Base year""  should be filled in only by those Parties with economies in transition that use a base year different from 1990 in accordance with the relevant decisions of the COP. For these Parties, this different base year is used to calculate the percentage change in the final column of this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   Fill in net emissions/removals as reported in table Summary 1.A. For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and for emissions positive (+). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) In accordance with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, for Parties that decide to report indirect CO2 the national totals shall be provided with and  without indirect CO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)  In accordance with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, HFC and PFC emissions should be reported for each relevant chemical.  However, if it is not possible to report values for each chemical (i.e. mixtures, confidential data, lack of disaggregation), this row could be used for reporting aggregate figures for HFCs and PFCs, respectively. Note that the unit used for this row is kt of CO2 equivalent and that appropriate notation keys should be entered in the cells for the individual chemicals. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)  Includes net CO2, CH4 and N2O from LULUCF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"• Parties should provide detailed explanations on emissions trends in chapter 2: Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and, as appropriate, in the corresponding Chapters 3 - 8 of the national inventory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.A.1.c.iv 1.A.1.c.iv  Other (: 
1.A.2.a Liquid Fuels: According to information provided by the national Statistical Service, fuel consumption for Iron and Steel production (1A2a) is included in non-ferrous metals production (1A2b)
1.A.2.b Liquid Fuels: Fuel consumption in 2013 according to the national statistical service is 0. Therefore respective cell is left empty.
1.A.2.f Other Fossil Fuel: This type of fuel, includes the non-biomass fraction of waste, since there is no other fuel category available that is more appropriate.
1.A.3.b.ii: due to unavailability of data, all fuel consumption is included in cars (1A3b(i))
1.A.3.b.ii Gasoline: due to unavailability of data, all fuel consumption is included in cars (1A3b(i))
1.A.3.b.ii Diesel Oil: due to unavailability of data, all fuel consumption is included in cars (1A3b(i))
1.A.3.b.ii Biomass: due to unavailability of data, all fuel consumption is included in cars (1A3b(i))

1.A.4.c.iii Gas/Diesel Oil: Due to unavailability of data all fuel consumption is included in cars (A3b(i) - Cars).
1.A.4.c.iii Gasoline: Due to unavailability of data all fuel consumption is included in cars (A3b(i) - Cars).
1.A.4.c.iii Biomass: Due to unavailability of data all fuel consumption is included in cars (A3b(i) - Cars).
1.B.2.a.3: Data not available.
1.B.2.a.5: Data not available.
2.G.1 SF6: where NE is used, the necessary activity data is not available to estimate the amounts or the emissions. The emissions have been estimated based on a country specific method and are all assumed to be from stocks since no data is available to estimate emissions from disposal.
3.A.1 Non-Dairy Cattle: The information is not sufficient to implement T2 methodology.
3.B.2.1 Dairy Cattle: L8: Methodology: Solid storage according to the guidelines
L11: Methodology: Anaerobic treatment according to the guidelines
3.B.2.1 Non-Dairy Cattle: L8: Methodology: Solid storage according to the quidelines
L11: Methodoligy: Anaerobic treatment according to the quidelines
3.B.2.2 Sheep: L8: Methodology: Solid storage according to the quidelines
3.B.2.3 Breeding swine: NMVOC (included elsewhere - Market swine)
L6: Methodology: Aerobic treatment according to the quidelines.
L11: Methodoligy: Anaerobic digester according to the quidelines
3.B.2.3 Market swine: L6: Methodology: Aerobic treatment according to the quidelines
L11: Methodology: Anaerobic digester according to the quidelines
3.B.2.5: No methodology recommended by the IPCC guidelines
3.D.1.6: Cyprus does not have agriculture soils with high organic matter.
3.D.AI.2: emissions from animal waste/sludge applied to soil not estimated due to unavailability of data

3.F.2.1.i Bean and Pulses: NE notation key was used due to the fact that no default (CF) is proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.
3.F.3.1.i Potatoes: NE notation key was used due to the fact that no default (CF) is proposed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.
5.A.2: Included elsewhere: ""IPCC Waste model"" was used. Breakdown not available.
5.D.2: Sludge removed: No data available
