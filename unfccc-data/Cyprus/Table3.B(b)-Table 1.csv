"(1)    Direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions associated with the manure deposited on agricultural soils and pasture, range and paddock systems are included under N2O emissions from managed soils (see table 3(III).D-E).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   The emissions associated with the burning of dung are to be reported under fuel combustion, if used as fuel and under waste incineration, if burned without energy recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) This could include pit storage, deep bedding, poultry manure with and without litter, aerobic treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)  Total nitrogen (N) volatilized does not include N volatilized from manure deposited in pasture, range and paddock systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)   Option C should be used when Parties want to report a more disaggregated livestock categorization compared with option A and option B. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)   If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from other livestock not included in subcategories 3.B.1-3.B.3 under other (please specify).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7)   This could include fox and raccoon and mink and polecat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
