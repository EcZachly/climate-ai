(1)   The implied emission factors (IEFs) for methane (CH4) are estimated on the basis of gross emissions as follows: (CH4 emissions + amounts of CH4 flared/recovered) / activity data.,,,,,,
"(2)   Amounts of CH4 drained (recovered), utilized or flared. If CH4 is recovered and flared the associated emissions should be included under 1.B.1.c.",,,,,,
(3)   Final CH4 emissions after subtracting the amounts of CH4 utilized or recovered. ,,,,,,
"(4)   In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines, emissions from Mining activities and Post-mining activities are calculated using the raw coal production for Underground mines and Surface mines. ",,,,,,
"(5)  Include fugitive emissions from coke and charcoal production under this category, recognizing that there are no methods for estimating fugitive emissions from coke and charcoal production in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,,,
"(6)   This category is to be used for reporting any other solid fuel related activities resulting in fugitive emissions, such as emissions from waste piles.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Note:  There are no clear references to the coverage of subcategories 1.B.1.b. and 1.B.1.c. in the IPCC Guidelines.  Make sure that the emissions entered here are not reported elsewhere. If they are reported under another category, indicate this by using the notation key ""IE"" (included elsewhere) and making the necessary reference in table 9 (completeness). ",,,,,,

• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the fugitive emissions from source category 1.B.1 Solid Fuels in the corresponding part of chapter 3: energy (CRF category 1.B.1) of the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the national inventory report  (NIR) if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.   ,,,,,,
"• Regarding data on the amount of fuel produced entered in the above table, specify in this documentation box whether the fuel amount is based on the run-of-mine production or on the saleable production.",,,,,,
"• If entries are made for Recovery/flaring, indicate in this documentation box whether CH4 is flared or recovered and provide a reference to the section in the NIR where further details on recovery/flaring can be found.",,,,,,
"• If estimates are reported under 1.B.1.b. and 1.B.1.c., use this documentation box to provide information regarding activities covered under these categories and to provide a reference to the section in the NIR where the background information can be found. ",,,,,,
