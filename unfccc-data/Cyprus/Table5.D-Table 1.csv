"(1) If sludge removal is reported in the wastewater inventory, it should be consistent with the estimates for sludge applied to agricultural soils, sludge incinerated and sludge deposited in solid waste disposal sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)    The methane (CH4) implied emission factor (IEF) is calculated on the basis of gross CH4 emissions as follows: IEF = (CH4 emissions + CH4 recovered or flared) / total organic product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3)   Parties using methods other than those from the IPCC for estimating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from human sewage or wastewater treatment should provide aggregate data in this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(4)   Actual emissions (after flaring and recovery).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5) When CH4 recovered is used for energy production, the emissions should be reported under category 1.A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)   DC = degradable organic component. DC indicators are COD (chemical oxygen demand) for industrial waste water and BOD  (biochemical oxygen demand) for domestic/commercial wastewater/sludge (2006 IPCC Guidelines (Volume 5. Section 6.1, pp. 6.7))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"• Regarding the estimates for N2O from human sewage, specify whether total or urban population is used in the calculations and the rationale for doing so. Provide an explanation in the documentation box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Parties using methods other than those from the IPCC for estimating N2O emissions from wastewater treatment should provide, in the national inventory report (NIR), corresponding information on methods, activity data and emission factors used, and should provide a reference to the relevant section  of the NIR in this documentation box. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"5.D.2: Sludge removed: No data available
N in effluent: Emission factor was based on volume of wastewater, therefore N in inffluent not estimated.
