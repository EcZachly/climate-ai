"(1)      If Cropland management has been elected, report here information on anthropogenic carbon stock change for the inventory year for all geographic locations that encompass land subject to cropland management under Article 3.4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)    If cropland management has been elected, this table and all relevant CRF tables shall also be reported for the base year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3)    Geographic location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to cropland management (if elected). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)    Activity data may be further subdivided according to climate zone, management system, soil type, vegetation type, tree species, ecological zone, national land classification or other criteria. Complete one row for each subdivision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)      The signs for estimates of gains in carbon stocks are positive (+) and of losses in carbon stocks are negative (-).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)      Carbon stock gains and losses should be listed separately except in cases where, due to the methods used, it is technically impossible to separate information on gains and losses.  In that case, net gains should be reported in the ""Gains"" column and net losses should be reported in the ""Losses"" column.  The notation key IE should be filled in, in the other column.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7)     The value reported here is an emission or removal and not a carbon stock change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(8)    CO2 emissions from dissolved organic carbon from drained and CO2 emissions/removals from rewetted organic soils may also be included here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9)     For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and for emissions positive (+). Net changes in carbon stocks are converted to CO2 by multiplying C by 44/12 and changing the sign for net CO2 removals to be negative (-) and for net CO2 emissions to be positive (+).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
