Parties should provide detailed explanation on how the subsequent removals to be excluded from accounting are calculated in the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(3)    Year when the natural disturbance took place ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)    The Party should report here emissions from natural disturbances. The values reported here should be consistent with, although not necessarily equal to the information provided in tables 4(KP-I)B.1.1 and  4(KP-II)4. Regardless of the method used to estimate carbon stock changes, the Party needs to provide information in the NIR on how CO2 emissions from natural disturbances were singled out, if necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)    Emissions from salvage logging in the inventory year (information on how emissions from salvage logging have been estimated should be provided in the NIR).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6)    Emissions reported here shall not include salvage logging emissions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7)   Information on the calculation of the background level and the margin should be provided in the NIR, including any recalculations made to the background level and the margin to maintain methodological consistency with the reported emissions and the forest management reference level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8)    If natural disturbances  emissions exceed the background level plus the margin, if a margin is applied, this cell should report ""yes"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9)   Emissions that can be excluded from the accounting in the inventory year equal ""Emissions from natural disturbances"" minus the ""Background level"". ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(10)   Parties should document in the NIR how the subsequent removals to be excluded from accounting are calculated. Parties should also document in the NIR that the methodology used is consistent with that used for the background level and margin, if applied. Parties should indicate in the documentation box where this information can be found in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(11)  If subsequent removals are equal to, or smaller than, removals included in the projected forest management reference level for these land, the  Party should report not applicable (NA).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(12)    Disturbances should be listed by year and type of disturbance (in this order, totals by year of natural disturbances to be included).  Multiple  natural disturbances  events of the same type, e.g. fires due to  a severe drought period, can be grouped provided that all relevant information is provided in the NIR or annexes to the NIR. Also in the case that an area is subject to multiple types of disturbances, additional information on how double-counting of emissions and removals is avoided should be provided in the NIR. Also in the case that the area is subject to disturbances in multiple years, additional information on how double counting of emissions and removals from these areas is avoided should be provided in the NIR. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(13)   Parties should report emissions from natural disturbances that occurred in the inventory year. The Party could also report delayed emissions from natural disturbances that have occurred in previous years, if consistent with the methodology used in the calculation of the background level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
