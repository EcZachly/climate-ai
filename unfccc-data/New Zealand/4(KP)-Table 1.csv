"Parties should provide detailed explanation on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in the relevant annex of the NIR: ""Supplementary information on LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol"". Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,

-: No methodology is provided in good practice guidance for methane emissions
-: No methodology is provided in good practice guidance
- N2O emissions from N mineral: Carbon stock changes (kt C) are reported as positive values as CRF reporter does not accept negative values in this row. 
- Wildfire: New Zealand is not applying the natural disturbance provision in 2013
- Land previously reported und: New Zealand does not have data by the necessary disaggregation to report for this

- N2O emissions from N mineral: 
- Domestically consumed: There was no harvesting of deforested land during the period so are no harvested wood products to report
- Exported: There was no harvesting of deforested land during the period so are no harvested wood products to report

(1)     All estimates in this table include emissions and removals from projects under Article 6 hosted by the reporting Party.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)    If cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation and/or wetland drainage and rewetting are elected, this table and all relevant CRF tables shall also be reported for the base year for these activities.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)    For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and for emissions positive (+). Net changes in carbon stocks are converted to CO2 by multiplying C by 44/12 and by changing the sign for net CO2 removals to be negative (-) and net CO2 emissions to be positive (+).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)    CH4 emissions reported here for cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation and/or wetland drainage and rewetting, if elected, include only emissions from drainage or rewetting of organic soils and from biomass burning (with the exception of savanna burning and agricultural residue burning which are reported in the agriculture sector).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)      N2O emissions reported here for cropland management, if elected, include only emissions from biomass burning (with the exception of savannah burning and agricultural residue burning which are reported in the agriculture sector).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)    As both afforestation and reforestation under Article 3.3 are subject to the same provisions specified in the annex to decision 2/CMP.7, they can be reported together. ",,,,,,,,,,,
