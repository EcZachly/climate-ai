(1) The CH4 implied emission factor (IEF) is calculated on the basis of gross methane (CH4) emissions as follows IEF = (CH4 emissions + CH4 recovered/flared)/annual waste at the solid waste disposal sites. ,,,,,,,,
(2) Actual emissions (after recovery and flaring).,,,,,,,,
"(3) When CH4 emissions recovered are used for energy, the emissions from the combustion should be reported under category 1.A.",,,,,,,,
(4) This category should include all organic waste from sources not covered by municipal solid waste.,,,,,,,,
Documentation box: ,,,,,,,,
• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the waste sector in chapter 7: waste (CRF sector 5) of the national inventory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,
• Parties should specify the category in the energy sector under which the emissions from energy recovery are reported. ,,,,,,,,
