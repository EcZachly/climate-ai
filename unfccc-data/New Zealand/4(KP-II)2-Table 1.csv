"(1)        Methodologies for CH4 and N2O emissions from drained and rewetted soils  are given in the ""Wetlands Supplement"" for all land-use categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)       N2O emissions from drained cropland and grazing land soils are covered in the agriculture sector under cultivation of histosols.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)       For activities other than wetland drainage and rewetting, a Party may choose to include CH4 emissions from drained, rewetted and other organic soils. A Party should provide detailed information on methodologies, emissions and removals from these subdivisions in the NIR, ensuring consistency in reporting among categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,
(4)      Geographical location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to the listed activities.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)    In the calculation of the implied emission factor, N2O emissions are converted to N2O-N by multiplying by 28/44.",,,,,,,,,,,,
(6)    Only N2O emissions which have not been reported under agriculture should be included here.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7)    Also includes emissions from drainage ditches, as appropriate. Detailed data should be provided in the NIR. On-site CH4 emissions from rice cultivation are included in the agriculture sector. Parties should avoid double counting.",,,,,,,,,,,,
