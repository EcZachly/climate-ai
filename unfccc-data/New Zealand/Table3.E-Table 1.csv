"(1) If possible, fires on forest land and grassland defined as savannah should be separately identified and reported here. If it is not possible to separate those fires from other forest and grassland fires reported under category 4(II).A Biomass Burning, this should be clearly documented in the documentation box and in the national inventory report (NIR). Parties should avoid double counting with emissions reported in CRF table 4(V).",,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Parties who wish to do so could report CH4 and N2O emissions from burning of organic soils here.  N2O emissions from burning of organic soils could be included when higher tier methods are used.,,,,,,,,,,,

Parties should provide detailed explanations on the agriculture sector in chapter 5: Agriculture (CRF sector 3) of the NIR. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"3.E/1990: Included under LULUCF 
3.E/1990: Prescribed burning of savanna is reported under the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, in order to be consistent with LULUCF reporting and to avoid double counting. See section 6.11.5 of the NIR (biomass burning (table 4(V) of LULUCF), category C. Grassland).
