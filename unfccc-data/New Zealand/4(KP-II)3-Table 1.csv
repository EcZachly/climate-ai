"(1)      N2O emissions from nitrogen mineralization/immobilization associated with loss/gain of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or management of mineral soils under afforestation/reforestation, deforestation, forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation should be reported here when these emissions/removals are not reported under the agriculture sector. ",,,,,,,,,,
(2)   Geographical location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to reported conversions and management changes.,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)   Land areas should include lands converted and/or lands where a management change has taken place and resulted in carbon loss. Gains could be reported, under tier 3 approaches, if sufficient scientific justification is provided.",,,,,,,,,,
"(4)   In the calculation of the implied emission factor, N2O emissions are converted to N2O-N by multiplying by 28/44.",,,,,,,,,,
(5)   Geographical location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to deforestation.,,,,,,,,,,
(6)   N2O emissions associated with deforestation followed by the establishment of cropland should be reported under deforestation even if cropland management is not elected under Article 3.4.,,,,,,,,,,
