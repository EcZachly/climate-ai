"Parties should provide detailed explanation on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in the relevant annex of the NIR: ""Supplementary information on LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol"".

(1)     Report here information on anthropogenic change in carbon stock for the inventory year for all geographical locations that encompass land subject to deforestation under Article 3.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)    Countries may provide information on the actual land use category in the reporting year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3)    Geographic location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to deforestation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)    Activity data may be further subdivided according to climate zone, management system, soil type, vegetation type, tree species, ecological zone, national land classification or other criteria. Complete one row for each subdivision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)      The signs for estimates of gains in carbon stocks are positive (+) and of losses in carbon stocks are negative (-).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)    Carbon stock gains and losses should be listed separately except in cases where, due to the methods used, it is technically impossible to separate information on gains and losses.  In that case, net gains should be reported in the ""Gains"" column and net losses should be reported in the ""Losses"" column.  The notation key IE should be filled in, in the other column.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7)    The value reported here is an emission and not a carbon stock change.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(8)   CO2 emissions from dissolved organic carbon from drained and CO2 emissions/removals from rewetted organic soils may also be included here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9)   Harvest from lands that is reported under deforestation and which originated from deforestation events at the time of the land-use change, shall be accounted on the basis of instantaneous oxidation (IO). Data to be reported in this table come from column ""Change in carbon stock net change"" in the 4(KP-I)C. A single value for the total net change in HWP at national level should be reported here. Furthermore, if HWP reporting is based on instantaneous oxidation then report IO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(10)     For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and for emissions positive (+). Net changes in carbon stocks are converted to CO2 by multiplying C by 44/12 and changing the sign for net CO2 removals to be negative (-) and for net CO2 emissions to be positive (+).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(11) Total for activity A.2 is the sum of the subtotals below.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(12) Emissions from areas previously included under natural disturbance and deforested in the inventory year.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(13) Reporting in these rows is required by Parties which apply the provision to exclude emissions from natural disturbances in accordance with paragraphs 33 and 34 in the annex to decision 2/CMP.7. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
