(1)  If the sources of nitrogen (N) cannot be separated other than between cropland and grasslands they should be included in the agriculture sector and reported in table 3.D(b). This should be explicitly indicated in the documentation box. ,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Methodologies for indirect N2O emissions are based on equations 11.9, 11.10 and 11.11 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,
"(3)   To convert from N2O–N to N2O emissions, multiply by 44/28. ",,,,,,,,,,
"(4)  Report atmospheric deposition and leaching and runoff of N from the following sources of N inputs: synthetic and organic N fertlizer from land use categories, other than cropland and grassland (these emissions are reported in the agriculture sector), and N mineralization associated with loss of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or management on mineral soils in all land use categories except for cropland remaining cropland.",,,,,,,,,,
