(1) A Party should only provide data for the approach it has chosen to use for reporting on harvested wood products.,,,,,,,,
"(2) Stock change approach. Refer to equations 12.1, 12.2 and 12.A.2 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,,,,,
(3) Categories are defined in table 12.5 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Countries may apply more detailed category breakdowns that better reflect their wood product industry.,,,,,,,,
"(4) Gains refers to annual carbon inflow to HWP pool, losses refers to annual carbon outflow from HWP pool.",,,,,,,,
"(5) Half-lives are needed when applying flux data methodology as suggested in equation 12.1 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  Following default half-lives may be used for HWP in use: sawnwood 35 years, wood panels 25 years, paper and paperboard 2 years (based on Table 3a.1.3 of the IPCC good practice guidance for LULUCF).",,,,,,,,
"(6) For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (–) and for emissions positive (+).  ",,,,,,,,
"(7) If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from solid wood under other solid wood products.      ",,,,,,,,
(8) Information reported in this table as an information item should be used to check consistency with the estimation in the waste sector.,,,,,,,,
(9) Data on HWP in SWDS may be provided on a voluntary basis. It excludes the carbon in CH4 emissions which is reported in the waste sector.,,,,,,,,
(10) See table 3.4 of volume 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.,,,,,,,,
(11) Waste subcategories as suggested in chapter 2.3.1 of volume 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines may be used. ,,,,,,,,
"(12) Production approach. Refer to equations 12.1, 12.3 and 12.A.6 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines or any other IPCC methodological guidance reflecting this approach.",,,,,,,,
"(13) A Party may choose to separately report HWP for domestically produced and consumed, and domestically produced and exported HWP.",,,,,,,,
"(14) Atmospheric flow approach. Refer to equations 12.1, 12.2 and 12.A.4 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,,,,,
