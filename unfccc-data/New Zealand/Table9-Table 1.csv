CH4,Agriculture,3.1  Livestock/3.A  Enteric Fermentation/3.A.4  Other livestock/Poultry,"NE: This category is not mandatory. The 2006 IPCC guidelines state in p.10.27, vol 4-2 that a T1 method for estimating CH4 emissions from Enteric fermentation for poultry has not been developed. Also, table 10-10 in p.10.28, vol 4-2 indicates that there is insufficient data to establish a CH4 EF for Poultry for either developed or developing countries.",,

CH4,Waste,5.C  Incineration and Open Burning of Waste/5.C.1  Waste Incineration/5.C.1.2  Non-biogenic/5.C.1.2.a  Municipal Solid Waste,"Approximately 100-200 rural schools in New Zealand still incinerate their waste production. Estimates indicate that this practice emits 0.04 kt CO2-e per year. NE (not estimated) is used because New Zealand does not have sufficient information regarding the practice of incinerating waste in schools, and the amount is negligible. This is in accordance with paragraph 37 (b) of the UNFCCC guidelines.",,

N2O,Agriculture,3.1  Livestock/3.B  Manure Management/3.B.2  N2O and NMVOC Emissions/3.B.2.5  Indirect N2O Emissions,"The IPCC (2006) guidelines for determining indirect N2O emissions does not provide a methodology for estimating emissions from leaching and run-off. In addition, indirect N2O emissions from leaching and run-off are insigificant in New Zealand, as almost all livestock are kept outdoors all year around on pasture.",,
N2O,Agriculture,3.D  Agricultural Soils/3.D.1  Direct N2O Emissions From Managed Soils/3.D.1.2  Organic N Fertilizers/3.D.1.2.c  Other Organic Fertilizers Applied to Soils,"Emissions from 'Other organic fertilisers applied to soils' are not estimated due to their insignificance.

Due to the small amount of emissions coming from sewage sludge, further disaggregation of the activity data is considered resource prohibitive.
