"(1)  This table should be used to report land area and changes in land area subject to the various activities in the inventory year. For each activity it should be used to report area change between the end of the previous inventory year and the end of the current inventory year. For example, the total area of land subject to forest management in the previous inventory year  and which was deforested in the current inventory year, should be reported in the deforestation column and in the forest management row.",,,,,,,,,,

"(3)  Lands subject to cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation or wetland drainage and rewetting that after 2013 are subject to activities other than those under Article 3.3 and 3.4, should still be tracked and reported under cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation or wetland drainage and rewetting, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,
