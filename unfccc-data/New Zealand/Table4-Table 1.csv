"(1) For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (–) and for emissions positive (+).  ",,,,,,,
"(2) For each land-use category and subcategory, this table sums the net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and removals shown in tables 4.A to 4.F, and the CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions shown in tables 4(I) – 4(V) and 4.G. ",,,,,,,
"(3) Parties may decide not to prepare estimates for CH4 emissions from flooded land contained in Appendix 3 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, although they may do so if they wish.",,,,,,,
"(4) This category includes bare soil, rock, ice, and all land areas that do not fall into any of the other five categories. It allows the total of identified land areas to match the national area.",,,,,,,
(5) Non-CO2 emissions from HWP are covered in the energy sector or waste sector.,,,,,,,

"• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in chapter 6: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (CRF sector 4) of the national inventory report (NIR). Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,
"• If estimates are reported under the category 4.H. Other, use this documentation box to provide information regarding activities covered under this category and to provide a reference to the section in the NIR where background information can be found. ",,,,,,,
