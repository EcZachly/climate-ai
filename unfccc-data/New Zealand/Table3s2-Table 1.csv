Documentation box,"3./1990: N2O emissions from goats are reported in the agricultural soils category (CRF 3.D.1.3). For more information see sections 5.3.2 (Direct nitrous oxide emissions from manure management) and 5.5.2 (urine and dung deposited by grazing animals) of the NIR.  In the case of NMVOC emissions, according to the footnote 6 to the paragraph 37(b) of the UNFCCC reporting GLs, this category is not mandatory for reporting. 
3./1990: NE:According to the footnote 6 to the paragraph 37(b) of the UNFCCC reporting GLs, this category is not mandatory for reporting. The 2006 IPCC guidelines state in p.10.27, vol 4-2 that a T1 method for estimating CH4 emissions from Enteric fermentation for poultry has not been developed. Also, table 10-10 in p.10.28, vol 4-2 indicates that there is insufficient data to establish a CH4 EF for Poultry for either developed or developing countries. 
3./1990: The change in implied emission factors over 1990-2020 for organic nitrogen fertilisers is due to the increased proportion of animal manure from dairy, which has a lower emission factor compared to manure from poultry and swine. For more information see section 5.5.2 (Organic nitrogen fertilisers) of the NIR. Emissions from swine and poultry are estimated using tier one methods. for more information see 5.1.4 (minor livestock categories) of the NIR. 
3./1990: Direct and indirect N2O emissions from the manure deposited by non-dairy cattle are reported under the Agricultural soils category (CRF 3.D.1.3). For more information see sections 5.3.2 (Direct nitrous oxide emissions from manure management) and 5.5.2 (urine and dung deposited by grazing animals) of the NIR. 
3./1990: Only population and emissions estimates for alpaca and llama are included in this table, and there are no Middle-eastern camels in New Zealand. The emissions from these animals are estimated using tier 1 methods. For more information see sections 5.1.3, 5.1.4 and 5.2.2 of the NIR 
3./1990: See section 5.1.1 (New Zealand farming practices and trends )  of the 2023 (1990-2021) NIR for an explanation of the reasons behind inter-annual changes in New Zealand's implied emission factors  
3./1990: Prescribed burning of savanna is reported under the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, in order to be consistent with LULUCF reporting and to avoid double counting. See section 6.11.5 of the NIR (biomass burning (table 4(V) of LULUCF), category C. Grassland). 
3./1990: N2O emissions from horses are reported in the agricultural soils category (CRF 3.D.1.3).

3./1990: Direct nitrous oxide emissions from anaerobic lagoons (dairy and swine) and daily spread (swine), are reported under Agricultural soils. The IPCC GL assume that negligible direct N2O emissions occur in anaerobic lagoons and daily spread, and only occur once the stored effluent is spread onto agricultural soil. The implied emission factor for pigs is affected by nitrogen excretion rates, which in turn is affected by pig weights. average pig weights have increased significantly since 1990 due to improvements in productivity. for more information see section 5.3.2 of the NIR (Nitrogen excretion rates for the minor livestock categories). Emissions from pigs are estimated using tier 1 methods. For more information see sections section 5.1.4 (minor livestock categories) and 5.3.2 (manure methane from minor livestock categories)of the NIR.  
3./1990: Emissions from mules and asses are estimated using tier 1 methods. For more information see sections 5.1.3 and 5.2.2 of the NIR 
3./1990: Emissions from horses are estimated using tier 1 methods. For more information see sections 5.1.3 and 5.2.2 of the NIR

3./1990: Specific data on the area of wheat burned (and biomass available) is not gathered by New Zealand, and is not used to calculate field burning emissions. To calculate emissions, production volumes and an estimate of the proportion of wheat area burned is used, along with country-specific parameters. For more information see section 5.7.2 of the NIR.  
3./1990: According to the footnote 6 to the paragraph 37(b) of the UNFCCC reporting GLs, this category is not mandatory for reporting.The IPCC (2006) guidelines for determining indirect N2O emissions does not provide a methodology for estimating emissions from leaching and run-off. In addition, indirect N2O emissions from leaching and run-off are insigificant in New Zealand, as almost all livestock are kept outdoors all year around on pasture.  
3./1990: According to the footnote 6 to the paragraph 37(b) of the UNFCCC reporting GLs, this category is not mandatory for reporting. The IPCC (2006) Guidelines do not provide guidance for reporting on other carbon-containing fertilisers. Other carbon-containing synthetic fertilisers besides limestone, dolomite and urea are not applied to agricultural land in New Zealand. 
3./1990: The notation key 'NO' is used up to 2006 because there were no buffalo recorded in New Zealand before 2007.  A small herd of around 200 buffalo were brought into NZ around 2007 for specialised cheese and dairy production. These buffalo are reported within the dairy herd so the notation key 'IE' is used from 2007 onwards. For more information see section 5.1.4 of the NIR (minor livestock categories) 
3./1990: Residues from herbage seeds are not burned in New Zealand. For more information see section 5.7.1 of the NIR 
3./1990: Specific data on the area of oats burned (and biomass available) is not gathered by New Zealand, and is not used to calculate field burning emissions. To calculate emissions, production volumes and an estimate of the proportion of oats area burned is used, along with country-specific parameters. For more information see section 5.7.2 of the NIR.  
3./1990: The implied emissions for inorganic fertiliser is affected by the proportion of nitrogen fertiliser that is urea. For more information see section 5.5.2 of the NIR (Synthetic nitrogen fertiliser). 
3./1990: Direct nitrous oxide emissions from anaerobic lagoons (dairy and swine) and daily spread (swine), are reported under Agricultural soils.

3./1990: Residues from onion crops are not burned in New Zealand. For more information see section 5.7.1 of the NIR 
3./1990: Direct nitrous oxide emissions from sewage sludge are reported under 5.A.1.a in the Waste sector. Sewage sludge activity data are obtained from water treatment industry surveys, and do not disaggregate the amount of sludge used for different purposes. Due to the small amount of emissions coming from sewage sludge, further disaggregation of the activity data is considered resource prohibitive. Sewage sludge is a very small source of nitrogen, contributing 84 tonnes of N annually (Van der Weerden et al., 2014). Emissions of N2O are less than 0.002 Gg.  
3./1990: Emissions from this category are insignificant in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of the Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Part I). Emissions are roughly estimated to be 20 kt CO2-e (van der Weerden et al., 2014). Emissions are below threshold of 0.05 per cent of national total GHG emissions and do not exceed 500kt CO2-e 
3./1990: Emissions from horses are estimated using tier 1 methods. For more information see section 5.3.2 of the NIR (manure methane from minor livestock categories) 
3./1990: Rice cultivation does not occur in New Zealand 
3./1990: See section 5.1.1 (New Zealand farming practices and trends ) of the 2023 (1990-2021) NIR for an explanation of the reasons behind inter-annual changes in New Zealand's implied emission factors
