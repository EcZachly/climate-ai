"Parties should provide detailed explanation on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in the relevant annex of the NIR: ""Supplementary information on LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol"". Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,

(1)    Geographical location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to the activity.,,,,,,,,,
"(2)    For each activity, activity data should be selected between area burned or fuel burned. Units will be ha for area burned, and kg dm for fuel burned. The implied emission factor will refer to the selected activity data with an automatic change in the units.",,,,,,,,,
(3)    Emissions from all carbon pools are reported here. Details on methodologies should be reported in the NIR.,,,,,,,,,
"(4)    If CO2 emissions from biomass burning are not already included in tables 4(KP-I)A.1, 4(KP-I)A.2, 4(KP-I)B.1, 4(KP-I)B.2, 4(KP-I)B.3, 4(KP-I)B.4  and 4(KP-I)B.5, they should be reported here. This should be clearly documented in the documentation box and in the NIR. Parties that include all carbon stock changes in the carbon stock tables above should report IE (included elsewhere) in the CO2 column.",,,,,,,,,
(5)    Parties who wish to do so may report CO2 emissions from burning of organic soils here. ,,,,,,,,,
"(6)    Parties should report controlled/prescribed burning and wildfires emissions separately, where appropriate.",,,,,,,,,
(7)   Greenhouse gas emissions from burning agriculture residues are reported in the agriculture sector.,,,,,,,,,
(8)     Greenhouse gas emissions from prescribed savanna burning are reported in the agriculture sector.,,,,,,,,,
