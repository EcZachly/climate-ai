"(1)   To convert from N2O-N to N2O emissions, multiply by 44/28. ",,,,
"(2)   For cultivation of histosols the unit of the IEF is kg N2O–N/ha. The emissions from cultivation/management of croplands and grasslands are to be included. For a definition of organic soils, see footnote 4, page 11.6 of chapter 11 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.",,,,
"(3)    Include the application of fertilizers on cropland and grassland. If the application of fertilizers to other land categories cannot be separately identified, this application should be included here.",,,,
(4)   Emissions from management changes in cropland remaining cropland would be reported in this table. ,,,,
"(5)  Methodologies for N2O emissions from N mineralization/immobilization associated with loss/gain of soil organic matter resulting management of mineral soils are based on equations 11.1, 11.2 and 11.8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. N2O immobilization associated with gain of organic matter resulting from management of mineral soils can be reported only when a Party applies a tier 3 approach in the relevant calculation.",,,,
"(6)   Only atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) volatilised from agricultural inputs of N are to be reported here, not including NOx associated with the burning of savannahs and crop residues.",,,,

Documentation box,"3.D/1990: Direct nitrous oxide emissions from sewage sludge are reported under 5.A.1.a in the Waste sector. Sewage sludge activity data are obtained from water treatment industry surveys, and do not disaggregate the amount of sludge used for different purposes. Due to the small amount of emissions coming from sewage sludge, further disaggregation of the activity data is considered resource prohibitive. Sewage sludge is a very small source of nitrogen, contributing 84 tonnes of N annually (Van der Weerden et al., 2014). Emissions of N2O are less than 0.002 Gg.  
3.D/1990: The implied emissions for inorganic fertiliser is affected by the proportion of nitrogen fertiliser that is urea. For more information see section 5.5.2 of the NIR (Synthetic nitrogen fertiliser). 
3.D/1990: N2O emissions from urine and dung are estimated using a combination of tier one and two methodology. For more information see section 5.5.2 (Urine and dung deposited by grazing animals) in the NIR. 
3.D/1990: Emissions from this category are insignificant in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of the Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Part I). Emissions are roughly estimated to be 20 kt CO2-e (van der Weerden et al., 2014). Emissions are below threshold of 0.05 per cent of national total GHG emissions and do not exceed 500kt CO2-e 
3.D/1990: New Zealand uses a Tier 1 methodology with country-specific parameters to calculate indirect N2O emissions from nitrogen leaching. For more information see section 5.5.2 (Leaching and runoff) of the NIR. 
3.D/1990: The change in implied emission factors over 1990-2020 for organic nitrogen fertilisers is due to the increased proportion of animal manure from dairy, which has a lower emission factor compared to manure from poultry and swine. For more information see section 5.5.2 (Organic nitrogen fertilisers) of the NIR. Emissions from swine and poultry are estimated using tier one methods. for more information see 5.1.4 (minor livestock categories) of the NIR.
