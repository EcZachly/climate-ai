"Parties should provide detailed explanation on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in the relevant annex of the NIR: Supplementary information on LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"- Domestically consumed: There was no harvesting of deforested land during the period so are no harvested wood products to report
- Exported: There was no harvesting of deforested land during the period so are no harvested wood products to report
- Domestically consumed: There was no harvesting of deforested land during the period so are no harvested wood products to report",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1)    Information on carbon conversion factors and activity data, including the annual inflow to the HWP pool for relevant categories based on domestic production, import, export and domestic consumption, if relevant, and information on how inherited emissions have been considered should be included in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)     Total harvest (e.g. m3 or kt C) from domestic forest from each category.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)   Includes sawnwood, wood-based panels, paper and paperboard, or  country-specific categories comprising such products, if applicable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)   Any country-specific subdivisions of HWP categories are included here, for example in accordance with table 2.8.1 of the IPCC 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance arising from the Kyoto Protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)   Half-lives are needed when applying flux data methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6)   Initial stock is the HWP stock of the specific product type at 1 January of the inventory year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7)   Gains refer to annual carbon inflow to the HWP pool; losses refer to annual carbon outflow from the HWP pool. The signs for estimates of gains in carbon stocks are positive (+) and of losses in carbon stocks are negative (-).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8) HWP from lands reported under deforestation, which originated from the deforestation event at the time of the land use change shall be accounted for on the basis of instantaneous oxidation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
(9)   Harvest from lands not included in activities under Art. 3.3 or forest management.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
