"(1)  The column ""Base year""  should be filled in only by those Parties with economies in transition that use a base year different from 1990 in accordance with the relevant decisions of the COP. For these Parties, this different base year is used to calculate the percentage change in the final column of this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   Fill in net emissions/removals as reported in table Summary 1.A. For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and for emissions positive (+). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) In accordance with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, for Parties that decide to report indirect CO2 the national totals shall be provided with and  without indirect CO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)  In accordance with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, HFC and PFC emissions should be reported for each relevant chemical.  However, if it is not possible to report values for each chemical (i.e. mixtures, confidential data, lack of disaggregation), this row could be used for reporting aggregate figures for HFCs and PFCs, respectively. Note that the unit used for this row is kt of CO2 equivalent and that appropriate notation keys should be entered in the cells for the individual chemicals. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)  Includes net CO2, CH4 and N2O from LULUCF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"• Parties should provide detailed explanations on emissions trends in chapter 2: Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and, as appropriate, in the corresponding Chapters 3 - 8 of the national inventory report (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
