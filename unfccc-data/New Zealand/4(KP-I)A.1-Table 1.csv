"Parties should provide detailed explanation on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in the relevant annex of the NIR: Supplementary information on LULUCF activities under the Kyoto Protocol. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box,"-: New Zealand has not yet applied the natural disturbance provision as yet so there is nothing to report in this table

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1)    As both afforestation and reforestation under Article 3.3 are subject to the same provisions specified in the annex to decision 2/CMP.7, they can be reported together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)    Geographic location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to afforestation and reforestation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)    Activity data may be further subdivided according to climate zone, management system, soil type, vegetation type, tree species, ecological zone, national land classification or other criteria. Complete one row for each subdivision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)      A Party should report on-site CO2 emissions from drained organic soils here. A Party may also choose to include emissions and removals from rewetted and other organic soils, including off-site CO2 emissions, here. A Party should provide detailed information on methodologies, emissions and removals from these subdivisions in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)     The signs for estimates of gains in carbon stocks are positive (+) and of losses in carbon stocks are negative (-).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)      Carbon stock gains and losses should be listed separately except in cases where, due to the methods used, it is technically impossible to separate information on gains and losses. In that case, net gains should be reported in the “Gains” column and net losses should be reported in the “Losses” column. The notation key included elsewhere (IE) should be filled in, in the other column.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7)    The value reported here is an emission and not a carbon stock change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(8)       CO2 emissions from dissolved organic carbon from drained and CO2 emissions/removals from rewetted organic soils may also be included here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9)      Data to be reported in this table come from the ""net change"" column of table 4(KP-I)C. A single value for the total net change in the HWP at national level should be reported here. Further, if HWP reporting is based on instantaneous oxidation, then report IO (instantaneous oxidation).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(10)     For the purposes of reporting, the signs for removals are always negative (-) and for emissions positive (+). Net changes in carbon stocks are converted to CO2 by multiplying C by 44/12 and changing the sign for net CO2 removals to be negative (-) and for net CO2 emissions to be positive (+).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(11)    Total for activity A.1 is the sum of the subtotals below.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(12)     Reporting in these rows is required by Parties which apply the provision to exclude emissions from natural disturbances in accordance with paragraphs 33 and 34 in the annex to decision 2/CMP.7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
