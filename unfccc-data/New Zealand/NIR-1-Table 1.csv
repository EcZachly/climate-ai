"(1)  Indicate R (reported), NR (not reported), IE (included elsewhere) or NO (not occurring), for each relevant activity under Article 3.3, forest management or any elected activity under Article 3.4, or instantaneous oxidation (IO) for carbon stock changes in harvest wood products (HWP). With the exception of HWP, if changes in a carbon pool are not reported , verifiable information in the national inventory report (NIR) must be provided that demonstrates that these unaccounted pools were not a net source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.  Indicate NA (not applicable) for each activity that is not elected under Article 3.4. Explanation about the use of notation keys should be provided in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)  Indicate R (reported), NE (not estimated), IE (included elsewhere) or NO (not occurring) for greenhouse gas sources reported, for each relevant activity under Article 3.3, forest management or any elected activity under Article 3.4.  Indicate NA (not applicable) for each activity that is not elected under Article 3.4. Explanation about the use of notation keys should be provided in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)  Includes CO2 emissions/removals from organic soils, including CO2 emissions from dissolved organic carbon associated with drainage and rewetting. On-site CO2 emissions/removals from drainage and rewetting from organic soils and off-site CO2 emissions via water-borne carbon losses from organic soils should be reported here for wetland drainage and rewetting. These emissions could be reported for other activities as appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)  HWP from lands reported under deforestation, which originated from the deforestation event at the time of the land-use change shall be accounted for on the basis of instantaneous oxidation (IO).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)  N2O emissions from fertilization of afforestation/reforestation, deforestation, forest management, revegetation and wetland drainage and rewetting should be reported here when these emissions are not reported under the agriculture sector. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)  CH4 and N2O emissions from drained and rewetted organic soils should be reported here, as appropriate, when emissions are not reported under the agriculture sector. For wetland drainage and rewetting only emissions from organic soils are included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7)  CH4 emissions from drained soils and drainage ditches should be reported here, as appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8)  N2O emissions from nitrogen mineralization/immobilization associated with loss/gain of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or management of mineral soils under afforestation/reforestation, deforestation, forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation should be reported here when these emissions are not reported under the agriculture sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9)  Emissions from burning of organic soils should also be included here, as appropriate. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(10)  If CO2 emissions from biomass burning are not already included under changes in carbon stocks, they should be reported under biomass burning. Parties that include CO2 emissions from biomass burning in their carbon stock change estimates should report IE (included elsewhere).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
