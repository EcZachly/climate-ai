"(1)   The implied emission factor implicitly takes account of all relevant corrections for continuously flooded fields without organic amendment, the correction for the organic amendments and the effect of different soil characteristics, if considered in the calculation of methane (CH4) emissions.",,,,,,,,
(2)   Harvested area is the cultivated area multiplied by the number of cropping seasons per year.,,,,,,,,
(3)   Specify dry weight or wet weight for organic amendments in the documentation box.,,,,,,,,
(4)   These rows are included to allow comparison with international statistics. CH4 emissions from upland rice are assumed to be zero.,,,,,,,,
