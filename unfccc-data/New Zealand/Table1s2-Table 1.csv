"(1)   Countries are asked to report emissions from international aviation and marine bunkers and multilateral operations, as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass, under Memo items.  These emissions should not be included in the national total emissions from the energy sector.  Amounts of biomass used as fuel are included in the national energy consumption but the corresponding CO2 emissions are not included in the national total as it is assumed that the biomass is produced in a sustainable manner.  If the biomass is harvested at an unsustainable rate, net CO2 emissions are accounted for as a loss of biomass stocks in the land use, land-use change and forestry sector. ",,,,,,,
