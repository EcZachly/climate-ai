(1)  Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from drained cropland and grassland soils are covered in the agriculture tables of the CRF under cultivation of organic soils.,,,,,,,,,
"(2) A Party should report further disaggregations of drained soils corresponding to the methods used. Tier 1 disaggregates soils into ""nutrient rich"" and ""nutrient poor"" areas, whereas higher-tier methods can further disaggregate soils into different peatland types, soil fertility or tree species.",,,,,,,,,
"(3)  In the calculation of the implied emission factor, N2O emissions are converted to N2O-N by multiplying by 28/44.  ",,,,,,,,,
"(4) If CO2 emissions or removals from drainage of wetland soils are not already included in tables 4.A to 4.F, they are to be reported here. Parties may also choose to report CO2 emissions or removals from rewetting and other management activities here unless they are included elsewhere.  They should be clearly documented in the documentation box and in the NIR. Double counting should be avoided. Parties that include all carbon stock changes in the carbon stock tables (4.A-4.F), should report IE (included elsewhere) in this column.",,,,,,,,,
"(5) In table 4, these emissions will be added to the respective land-use category. ",,,,,,,,,
(6) On-site CH4 emissions /removals from rice cultivation are included in the agriculture sector.,,,,,,,,,
Documentation box:,,,,,,,,,
"Parties should provide detailed explanations on the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in Chapter 6: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (CRF sector 4) of the national inventory report (NIR). Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,
