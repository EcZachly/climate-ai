"(1) Estimate the percentage change due to recalculation with respect to the previous submission (percentage change = 100 x [(LS-PS)/PS], where LS = latest submission and PS = previous submission. All cases of recalculation of the estimate of the source/sink category should be addressed and explained in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Total emissions refer to total aggregate GHG emissions expressed in terms of CO2 equivalent, excluding GHGs from the LULUCF sector. The impact of the recalculation on the total emissions is calculated as follows:  impact of recalculation (%) = 100 x [(source (LS) - source (PS))/total emissions (LS)], where LS = latest submission, PS = previous submission.",,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
