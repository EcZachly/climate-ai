"(1) The implied emission factors (IEFs) for carbon dioxide (CO2) are estimated on the basis of gross emissions, i.e. CO2 emissions + amount captured.",,,,,,,,,
(2) Final CO2 emissions after subtracting the amounts of CO2 captured.,,,,,,,,,
"(3)  If activity data are calculated using net calorific values (NCVs) specified by the IPCC Guidelines, write NCV in this column. If gross calorific values (GCVs) are used, write GCV in this column.",,,,,,,,,
(4) Include information in the documentation box on which fuels are included and provide a reference to the section in the national inventory report (NIR) where further information is provided.,,,,,,,,,
"(5) Although peat is not strictly speaking a fossil fuel, the CO2 emissions from combustion of peat are included in the national emissions as for fossil fuels. See the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, chapter 1 of energy volume, page 1.15.",,,,,,,,,
"(6) Although CO2 emissions from biomass are reported in this table, they will not be included in the total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion. The value for total CO2 from biomass is recorded in table1 sheet 2 under the Memo Items. ",,,,,,,,,
"(7)  If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from public electricity and heat production here.",,,,,,,,,
"(8)  If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from manufacture of solid fuels and other energy industries here.",,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from manufacturing industries and construction not included in subcategories 1.A.2.a-1.A.2.f here.",,,,,,,,,
(10)  Domestic aviation and navigation should not include emissions from military aviation and navigation. The emissions from military mobile sources should be reported under category 1.A.5.b.,,,,,,,,,

Documentation Box,,,,,,,,,
• Parties should provide detailed explanations on the fuel combustion subsector in the corresponding part of chapter 3: energy (CRF subsector 1.A) of the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.  ,,,,,,,,,
"• If estimates are based on GCVs, use this documentation box to provide reference to the relevant section of the NIR where the information necessary for the calculation of the activity data based on NCVs can be found. ",,,,,,,,,
"• If some derived gases (e.g. gas works gas, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas) are considered, use this documentation box to provide a reference to the relevant section of the NIR containing the information on the allocation of these derived gases under the above fuel categories (liquid, solid, gaseous, biomass and other fuels).",,,,,,,,,
