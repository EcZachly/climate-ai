"(1)   Specify the activity data (AD) used in the description column (see examples). Specify the unit of the AD in the unit column in either energy units or volume units (e.g. PJ, 106 m3 and 106 bbl/yr).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)  The implied emission factors (IEFs) for carbon dioxide (CO2) are estimated on the basis of gross emissions, i.e. CO2  emissions + amount captured. ",,,,,,,,,,,
(3)   Net CO2 emissions after subtracting the amounts of CO2 captured.,,,, ,,,,,,,
"(4)  In this table, fugitive CH4 emissions should also be reported for the transmission/distribution of biogas. Emissions associated with the biogas production without energy production should be included in the waste sector under biological treatment of waste (CRF Table 5.B). ",,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)   The unit of the IEF will depend on the unit of the AD used, and is therefore not specified in this column.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)   Use the category also to cover emissions from combined oil and gas production fields. Natural gas processing and distribution from these fields should be included under subcategories 1.B.2.b.iii and 1.B.2.b.v, respectively. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"(7)   If using default emission factors, these categories will include emissions from production other than venting and flaring.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(8)  For emissions from flaring, this table should only be used for reporting of flaring emissions associated with oil/gas extraction and refining.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(9)    For example, fugitive CO2 emissions from production of geothermal power could be reported here.",,,,,,,,,,,

Documentation box:,,,,,,,,,,,
•  Parties should provide detailed explanations on the fugitive emissions from category 1.B.2 Oil and Natural gas in the corresponding part of chapter 3: energy (CRF category 1.B.2) of the NIR.  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.  ,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Regarding data on the amount of fuel produced entered in this table, specify in this documentation box whether the fuel amount is based on the raw material production or on the saleable production.  Note cases where more than one type of AD is used to estimate emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,
"• Venting and Flaring: Parties using the IPCC software could report venting and flaring emissions together, indicating this in this documentation box. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"• If estimates are reported under 1.B.2.d. Other, use this documentation box to provide information regarding activities covered under this category and to provide a reference to the section in the NIR where background information can be found. ",,,,,,,,,,,
