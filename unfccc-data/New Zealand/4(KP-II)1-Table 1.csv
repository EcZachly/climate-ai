"(1)    N2O emissions from fertilization for cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation  as well as from fertilization of areas categorized as cropland or grassland underdeforestation  should be reported in the agriculture sector.  If a Party is not able to separate fertilizer applied to forest land from agriculture, it may report all N2O emissions from fertilization in the agriculture sector.  In this case, reporting of N2O emissions from fertilization should not be included under afforestation/reforestation, deforestation or forest management, revegetation or wetland drainage and rewetting, as appropriate, to avoid double counting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)     Direct and indirect N2O emissions from fertilization are estimated following section 11.2 of the 2006 IPCC guidelines based on the amount of fertilizer applied to land under forest management. The indirect N2O emissions from afforestation and reforestation and land under forest management are estimated as part of the total indirect emissions in the agriculture sector based on the total amount of fertilizer used in the country. Parties should show that double counting of N2O emissions from fertilization with agriculture sector estimates has been avoided.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3)      Geographical location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass land subject to each activity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)      In the calculation of the implied emission factor, N2O emissions are converted to N2O-N by multiplying by 28/44.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5)    Only for areas that have been subsequently reforested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6)    Only N2O emissions which have not been reported under agriculture should be included here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
