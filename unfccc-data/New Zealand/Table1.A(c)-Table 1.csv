"(1)   ""Sectoral approach"" is used to indicate the approach (if different from the reference approach) used by the Party to estimate  carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion as reported in table 1.A(a), sheets 1-4. ",,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   Difference in CO2 emissions estimated by the reference approach (RA) and the sectoral approach (SA)  (difference = 100% x ((RA-SA)/SA)). For calculating the difference in energy consumption between the two approaches, data as reported in the column ""Apparent energy consumption (excluding non-energy use, reductants and feedstocks)"" are used for the reference approach.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
(3)   Apparent energy consumption data shown in this column are as in table 1.A(b). ,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)   For the purposes of comparing apparent energy consumption in the reference approach with energy consumption in the sectoral approach, data in this column come from table 1.A(d).",,,,,,,,,,
(5)   For the sectoral approach gross emissions (without accounting for CO2 captured) are included in the comparison.,,,,,,,,,,
"(6) In the case of discrepancies between the approaches (of more than 2 per cent), investigate and document the reasons for such discrepancies.",,,,,,,,,,

"â€¢ Parties should provide detailed explanations on the fuel combustion subsector, including information related to the comparison of CO2 emissions calculated using the sectoral approach with those calculated using the reference approach, in the corresponding part of chapter 3: energy (CRF subsector 1.A) of the national inventory report  (NIR).  Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional information and/or further details are needed to understand the content of this table.",,,,,,,,,,
