"(1)   Where the IPCC Guidelines provide options for activity data (AD), e.g. cement production or clinker production for estimating the emissions from cement production, specify the activity data used (as shown in the example in parentheses) in order to make the choice of emission factor more transparent and to facilitate comparisons of implied emission factors (IEFs).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)   The IEFs are estimated on the basis of gross emissions as follows: IEF = (emissions plus amounts recovered, oxidized, destroyed or transformed) / AD. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3)   Final emissions are to be reported (after subtracting the amounts of emission recovery, oxidation, destruction or transformation). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4)   Amounts of emission recovery, oxidation, destruction or transformation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5)    To ensure that double counting does not occur, fuel consumption (e.g. natural gas) in ammonia production should not be included in the energy sector.  Should CO2 from ammonia production be recovered for downstream use and be excluded from the reporting in category 2.B.1, the products and the purposes for which the CO2 is used should be clearly explained in the NIR for the most recent inventory year. The related CO2 emissions from these products and significant uses shall be reported in the relevant source categories in the inventory if these emissions occur within the borders of the Party concerned. Parties shall provide an overview in the NIR in which other source categories of the GHG inventory CO2 emissions from significant uses of urea are reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6)   If data are available, Parties are encouraged to report at the disaggregated level available from the pre-defined drop-down menu. Furthermore, Parties are encouraged to the extent possible to use the pre-defined category definitions rather than to create similar categories. This ensures the highest possible degree of comparability of the reporting. If detailed data are not available, Parties should include all emissions from petrochemical and carbon black production not included in subcategories 2.B.8.a-2.B.8.f here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
