Parties should provide detailed explanation on how the subsequent removals to be excluded from accounting are calculated in relevant annex of the NIR. Use this documentation box to provide references to relevant sections of the NIR if any additional details are needed to understand the content of this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1) Reporting in this table is required by Parties which apply the provision to exclude emissions from natural disturbances in accordance with paragraphs 33 and 34 in the annex to decision 2/CMP.7 and have indicated their intent to apply the referred provision in their report to facilitate the calculation of the assigned amount in accordance with paragraph 1(k) in annex I to decision 2/CMP.8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Geographic location refers to the boundaries of the areas that encompass the lands subject to natural disturbances under afforestation and reforestation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) Year when the natural disturbance took place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) The Party should report here emissions from natural disturbances. The values reported here should be consistent with, although not necessarily equal to, information provided in tables 4(KP-I)A.1 and  4(KP-II)4. Regardless of the method used to estimate carbon stock changes, the Party needs to provide information in the NIR on how CO2 emissions from natural disturbances were singled out, if necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) Emissions from salvage logging in the inventory year (information on how emissions from salvage logging have been estimated should be provided in the NIR).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6) Emissions reported here shall not include salvage logging emissions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(7) Information on the calculation of the background level and the margin should be provided in the NIR, including any recalculations made to the background level and the margin to maintain methodological consistency with the reported emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(8) If emissions from natural disturbances exceed the background level plus the margin, if a margin is needed, this cell should report ""yes"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(9) Emissions that can be excluded from the accounting in the inventory year equal ""emissions from natural disturbances"" minus the ""background level"". ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(10) Parties should document in the document box below, and in the NIR, how the subsequent removals to be excluded from accounting are calculated. Parties should also document that the methodology used is consistent with that used for the background level and margin, if applied. Parties should indicate in the documentation box where this information can be found in the NIR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(11) Disturbances should be listed by year and type of disturbance (in this order, totals by year of natural disturbances to be included).  Multiple  natural disturbances events of the same type, such as fires due to  a severe drought period, can be grouped provided that all relevant information is provided in the NIR or annexes to the NIR. Also in the case that an area is subject to multiple types of disturbances, additional information on how double-counting of emissions and removals is avoided should be provided in the NIR. Also in the case that the area is subject to disturbances in multiple years, additional information on how double counting of emissions and removals from these areas is avoided should be provided in the NIR. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(12) Parties should report emissions from natural disturbances that occurred in the inventory year. Parties could also report delayed emissions from natural disturbances that have occurred in previous years, if consistent with the methodology used in the calculation of the background level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
